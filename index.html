            <h2>What is Dog-Gone?</h2> 
            <p>It all started when I was looking for an ID Tag for our dogs that would allow us to be alerted if they were found.</p> 
            <p>Turns out there are quite a few already on the market, But it seemed that they were all more interested in  my details, than my dogs!</p>
            <p>They all wanted me to pay them a subscription or sign up to an app, which is great if you're into that kind of thing, but I just want to be contacted if someone finds my dog!</p>
            <p>So, I decided to do it myself and being a nice person, I thought I'd share it for free.</p>

            <h2>The Dog-Gone QR Code</h2>
            <p>The Dog-Gone QR code can be engraved into a metal tag to be attached to your dogs collar or harness, when it's scanned on a mobile phone it will open a web page containing;</p>
            <p>- Your dogs name</p>
            <p>- Your phone number</p>
            <p>- Second phone number (Optional)</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>The finder can then call you directly or they can click a button on the page to send you a text message with their current GPS location details.</p>

            <h2>How to use the QR Code?</h2>
            <p>It's simple, you just download the QR code image and use it to create your tag.  The only details you'll be asked to enter are;</p>
            <p>Your dogs name and your contact number(s).</p>
            <p>Your details will only ever appear on the screen of the person who scans your tag. They're not captured by us, or shared in any way.</p>
            <p>You can order a tag, either by using the link provided on the QR code page, or send it to any local engraving service to make a tag of your choice.</p>
